- `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- `npm install -g bower`
- `git clone https://github.com/roots/roots.git` into your Vagrant or MAMP theme folder
- Once Roots is downloaded to the correct location. Run `npm install` *this will install everything you need locally*
- Because we aren't setting up Bedrock yet add `define('WP_ENV', 'development');` to your `wp-config.php`
- If you run into issues with the bower command - Run `bower install` then `grunt dev`
